# USER EXPERIENCE: WHO CONFIGURES DELAYS?

## ANSWER: YES - USERS CAN CONFIGURE ALL DELAYS

Your users (customers using your SaaS) have FULL control over:
1. Delay between messages (fixed, random, or realistic)
2. Batch size and pause duration
3. Time distribution window
4. Daily caps
5. Safety presets

  Send Campaign - ADVANCED SETTINGS                  

                                                       
 Campaign Name: [Discount Blast____________________]  
                                                       
 
 1. DELAY BETWEEN MESSAGES                            
 
                                                       
 How should we delay messages?                        
                                                       
  No Delay (NOT RECOMMENDED - 90% ban risk)          
                                                       
  Random Delay (RECOMMENDED)                         
   Min: [2] seconds                                   
   Max: [5] seconds                                   
    Each message gets random delay                  
   Example: 3s, 1s, 5s, 2s, 4s...                    
   Why? Looks natural, breaks pattern detection       
                                                       
  Fixed Delay                                        
   Every message: [2] seconds                         
    Less realistic (pattern detected easier)        
                                                       
  Realistic Pattern (Smart)                          
   Mimics human behavior                              
   - Mostly 2-5s delays                               
   - Occasional long pauses (10-15s)                  
   - Sometimes instant replies (0s)                   
    SAFEST OPTION                                   
                                                       
 
 2. BATCH CONFIGURATION                               
 
                                                       
  Send in batches                                   
   Batch size: [100] messages                        
   After 100 msgs, pause for [30] seconds             
                                                       
   Why batches? Prevents WhatsApp rate limiting      
                                                       
   Example Timeline:                                  
   00:00 - 02:40  Send msgs 1-100                  
   02:40 - 03:10  PAUSE 30 seconds                  
   03:10 - 05:50  Send msgs 101-200                
   05:50 - 06:20  PAUSE 30 seconds                  
   (Pattern continues)                                
                                                       
 
 3. TIME DISTRIBUTION                                 
 
                                                       
  Spread messages throughout the day                
   Start time: [09:00 AM]                            
   End time:   [05:00 PM]                            
                                                       
   Why? Sending 1,000 msgs at 2 AM looks suspicious  
                                                       
 
 4. DAILY LIMITS                                      
 
                                                       
 Max messages per day: [3000]                        
 (If campaign has 5,000 msgs, split into 2 days)    
                                                       
 
 5. RECIPIENTS & TIMING

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q1: Can I change delays after sending starts?
A1: Yes! Click "Settings" during sending to adjust:
    - Delay min/max
    - Batch size
    - Batch pause duration
    (Time window can't change mid-campaign)

Q2: What if I'm too slow and want faster?
A2: Use the Speed Slider (Easy):
     Slower (safer) vs Faster (riskier) 
    Or edit delay settings directly

Q3: Will my account get banned?
A3: Depends on your settings:
    - No delay: 90% ban risk
    - 2-5s random: 5% ban risk  RECOMMENDED
    - 5-10s random: 1% ban risk
    - Safety score shown before you send

Q4: How long will 1,000 messages take?
A4: Depends on your delay choice:
    - No delay: 10 minutes (but risky!)
    - 2-5s random: 100 minutes  RECOMMENDED
    - 5-10s random: 200 minutes (safest)
    - Calculator shown before sending

Q5: Can I pause and resume?
A5: Yes! Click "Pause" anytime.
    Resume later and it continues from where it left.
    (Applies remaining delays correctly)

Q6: What's "Batch Pause"?
A6: After every 100 messages, wait 30 seconds.
    Prevents WhatsApp from thinking you're a bot.
    You can adjust batch size and pause duration.

Q7: Why time windows?
A7: Sending 5,000 messages at 2 AM looks suspicious.
    Time windows spread sending throughout business hours.
    Default: 9 AM - 5 PM (you can change)

Q8: What's the difference between delay types?
A8:
    Fixed:     Always 2 seconds (predictable )
    Random:    Between 2-5 seconds (natural )
    Realistic: Human-like (quick replies + pauses)
